        "strategy = \"\"\"This strategy takes into account market conditions, individual asset risks, and returns to allocate investments intelligently. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
        "1. Understanding Inputs:\n",
        "•Probabilities: These are predicted probabilities of a market crash for upcoming periods.\n",
        "•Tickers: The stock or asset identifiers (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).\n",
        "•Returns: Expected returns for each asset.\n",
        "•Risk Levels: Assets are categorized into risk levels (high, moderate, low).\n",
        "•Investment Amount: The total amount of money you want to invest.\n",
        "2. Market Trend Analysis:\n",
        "•The average crash probability is calculated.\n",
        "•If the average probability is less than 50%, the market is considered bullish (optimistic growth 'outlook').\n",
        "•If the probability is 50% or more, the market is considered bearish (higher risk of downturn).\n",
        "3. Define Strategy for Each Market Trend:\n",
        "•Bullish Market (Optimistic):\n",
        "•Prioritize high-risk assets for growth potential: 60% to high-risk, 30% to moderate-risk, and 10% to low-risk.\n",
        "•Bearish Market (Cautious):\n",
        "•Shift focus to low-risk assets: 20% to high-risk, 30% to moderate-risk, and 50% to low-risk.\n",
        "4. Adjust Asset Weights:\n",
        "•Each asset's weight is initially calculated based on its expected returns and risk level:\n",
        "•Higher returns increase the weight.\n",
        "•Higher risk decreases the weight by multiplying it with a risk factor:\n",
        "•High-risk assets are scaled down (factor = 0.5).\n",
        "•Moderate-risk assets remain neutral (factor = 1.0).\n",
        "•Low-risk assets are scaled up (factor = 1.5).\n",
        "•These adjusted weights are normalized so they sum to 1.\n",
        "5. Apply the Market Strategy:\n",
        "•The weights are modified further based on the current market trend.\n",
        "•For example:\n",
        "•In a bearish market, low-risk assets receive a higher allocation according to the strategy.\n",
        "6. Allocate Investments:\n",
        "•Using the final weights, the total investment amount is distributed across the tickers proportionally.\n",
        "•The strategy ensures that all available funds are allocated while respecting the calculated weights.\n",
        "Example Walkthrough:\n",
        "Let's say:\n",
        "•Investment Amount: $10,000\n",
        "•Tickers: AAPL, TSLA, XLY, XLU, TLT, GLD\n",
        "•Returns: {AAPL: 0.6, TSLA: 1.2, XLY: 0.8, XLU: 0.3, TLT: 0.2, GLD: 0.3}\n",
        "•Risk Levels: [high, high, moderate, low, low, low]\n",
        "•Probabilities: [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2] (average crash probability: 0.275 → Bullish market).\n",
        "Result:\n",
        "1.Market Trend: Bullish.\n",
        "2.Investment Allocation:\n",
        "•High-risk assets (AAPL, TSLA): 60% of investments, distributed proportionally to their weights.\n",
        "•Moderate-risk asset (XLY): 30% of investments.\n",
        "•Low-risk assets (XLU, TLT, GLD): 10% of investments.\n",
        "3.Total Investment: $10,000 distributed as per the above proportions.\n",

            "assistant: The `allocate_investment` function uses a data-driven strategy to allocate investments across different assets. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Understanding Inputs**: The function takes in several inputs, including:\n",
            "\t* `probabilities`: Predicted probabilities of a market crash for upcoming periods.\n",
            "\t* `tickers`: Stock or asset identifiers (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).\n",
            "\t* `returns`: Expected returns for each asset.\n",
            "\t* `risk_levels`: Assets are categorized into risk levels (high, moderate, low).\n",
            "\t* `investment_amount`: The total amount of money to invest.\n",
            "2. **Market Trend Analysis**: The function calculates the average crash probability and determines the market trend:\n",
            "\t* If the average probability is less than 50%, the market is considered **bullish** (optimistic growth outlook).\n",
            "\t* If the probability is 50% or more, the market is considered **bearish** (higher risk of downturn).\n",
            "3. **Define Strategy for Each Market Trend**: Based on the market trend, the function defines a strategy for allocating investments:\n",
            "\t* **Bullish Market**: Prioritize high-risk assets for growth potential:\n",
            "\t\t+ 60% to high-risk assets\n",
            "\t\t+ 30% to moderate-risk assets\n",
            "\t\t+ 10% to low-risk assets\n",
            "\t* **Bearish Market**: Shift focus to low-risk assets:\n",
            "\t\t+ 20% to high-risk assets\n",
            "\t\t+ 30% to moderate-risk assets\n",
            "\t\t+ 50% to low-risk assets\n",
            "4. **Adjust Asset Weights**: The function calculates each asset's weight based on its expected returns and risk level:\n",
            "\t* Higher returns increase the weight.\n",
            "\t* Higher risk decreases the weight by multiplying it with a risk factor:\n",
            "\t\t+ High-risk assets are scaled down (factor = 0.5).\n",
            "\t\t+ Moderate-risk assets remain neutral (factor = 1.0).\n",
            "\t\t+ Low-risk assets are scaled up (factor = 1.5).\n",
            "\t* These adjusted weights are normalized so they sum to 1.\n",
            "5. **Apply the Market Strategy**: The function modifies the weights further based on the current market trend:\n",
            "\t* For example, in a bearish market, low-risk assets receive a higher allocation according to the strategy.\n",
            "6. **Allocate Investments**: The function distributes the total investment amount across the tickers proportionally based on the final weights:\n",
            "\t* The strategy ensures that all available funds are allocated while respecting the calculated weights.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the example walkthrough, the `allocate_investment` function:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Determines the market trend is **bullish** (average crash probability: 0.275).\n",
            "2. Allocates investments according to the bullish market strategy:\n",
            "\t* 60% to high-risk assets (AAPL, TSLA)\n",
            "\t* 30% to moderate-risk asset (XLY)\n",
            "\t* 10% to low-risk assets (XLU, TLT, GLD)\n",
            "3. Distributes the $10,000 investment amount proportionally across the tickers based on their weights.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following this strategy, the `allocate_investment` function makes informed investment decisions based on market conditions, individual asset risks, and returns.\n"
